Sure bro, here's a clean and clear README.md for your LLM Intent Routing Framework ‚Äî meant for showcasing the project (not SoulOS), highlighting the modular multi-LLM architecture, zero hallucination focus, and test achievements.
# üí° Modular LLM Intent Routing Framework (Zero-Hallucination)

This is a scalable, modular intent-routing framework built using **multi-LLM architecture** with **intent clustering**, designed to reduce hallucinations even at high scale (100+ intents).

Unlike traditional agent frameworks, this project focuses on **precision**, **parallel execution**, and **layered classification** to maintain **zero hallucination** behavior even under complex routing.

## üß± Architecture

## üß† Architecture Design

This project follows a modular, parallel LLM-based architecture designed to **minimize hallucination**, **improve intent accuracy**, and **scale with hundreds of tools**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works

- **Parallel Input Dispatch:**  
  User input is simultaneously sent to multiple LLM clusters (e.g., `Create_ops`, `System_ops`) using multi-threading.  

- **Cluster-Level LLMs:**  
  Each LLM is specialized for a category of operations and holds its own set of tightly scoped intents and prompt structure.

- **Dedicated Routers:**  
  Once an LLM classifies an intent, it passes control to a category-specific router (like creating files, launching apps, etc.)

- **Isolated Response Handling:**  
  Each cluster handles its own logic and tools, then returns

### Example:
- Layer 1: Classifies as `file_ops` cluster
- Layer 2: Routes to `create_json` intent
- Layer 3: Calls tool or 3rd LLM for file generation

## üìä Testing Report

- **Total Intents:** 200
- **Test Cases:** 140 random natural prompts
- **Accuracy:** 95.7%
- **Hallucinations:** 0
- **Mismatches:** 6 (due to incomplete/ambiguous prompt)
- **Notes:** Even mismatches were caught via fallback `"unknown"` intent logic.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- Google Gemini API (2.5 Pro Vision)
- Multithreaded execution (for parallel routing)
- JSON-based test framework

üß† Why This Matters
Large LLMs often fail when loaded with too many instructions. This framework:

Breaks down intent handling using cluster-first architecture
Leverages multiple smaller prompts instead of one long, brittle one
Enables zero hallucination routing even as scale increases
